ASM-Detector
===
v1.0.0-beta

# 1.Introduction
ASM-Detector implements a novel computational method to better detect ASMs from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data. It takes SAM format mapped reads along with FASTA format reference genome as input. In the first step, a serie of parameters are used to select the condidate ASM regions with high quality. Then our graph-based clustering method is applied to detect ASM regions. The output of ASM-Detector includes summary of all detected ASM regions and reads partition results of each ASM region, which can be used in downstream analysis. ASM-Detector also provides several useful tools to perform further analysis of ASM regions, such as visulizing ASM regions in figure.
